## Possible Side Effects‚ö†Ô∏è

- WILL unsafely downgrade all `HTTPS` requests that matched host rules in your browser URL bar or iframe to `HTTP` to make HostsWitch take effect. Please make sure this extension is enabled only on websites with secure content.
- strict Cookie strategy (`SameSite=Strict` or `SameSite=Lax`) may cause problems in 'URL-host-matched' `Iframe`. Because of these strategies, the REDIRECTED UNSAFE Iframe request will be blocked by browsers from setting cookies and therefore may fail to load `Iframe` pages correctly.
