## Caveats

- ‚ö†Ô∏èwill UNSAFELY downgrade all `HTTPS` requests that match the host rules in your browser URL bar or iframe to `HTTP` to make HostsWitch take effect. Please make sure this extension is enabled only on websites with secure content.
- ‚ö†Ô∏èstrict Cookie strategy (`SameSite=Strict` or `SameSite=Lax`) may cause problems in 'URL-host-matched' `Iframe`. Because of these strategies, the REDIRECTED UNSAFE Iframe request will be blocked by browsers from setting cookies and therefore may FAIL to load `Iframe` pages correctly.
- ‚ö†Ô∏èsome sites may lead to infinite redirection and thus fail to load page `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`. Opening this page in `InPrivate Mode` will fix this problem.
